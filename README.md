# Final Capstone Project
This is a project of performance management tracker for a shoe warehouse, To optimize their delivery time and for improved organization.
Shoe warehouses store the following information for each stock-taking list:
  ● Country ● Code ● Product ● Cost ● Quantity 
Other store managers (in other regions) would like to be able to use this program to do the following:
  ● Search products by code.
  ● Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
  ● Determine the product with the highest quantity.
  ● Calculate the total value of each stock item. The total value is calculated by multiplying the cost by the quantity of each item entered into the system
